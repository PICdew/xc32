# We default to building libraries optimised for size, no debug
# information, and without gp-rel addressing. We switch off
# sibling-call optimization to permit interlinking of MIPS16 and
# non-MIPS16 functions. The -mcode-xonly option allows MIPS16
# libraries to run on Harvard-style split I/D memories, so long as
# they have the D-to-I redirect for pc-relative loads.
